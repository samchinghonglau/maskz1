Comparison:
time ./sRead 10:                    time ./aRead 10:
real	0.113s                      real: 0.015s

time ./sRead 100:                   time ./aRead 100:
real	1.088s                      real: 0.016s

time ./sRead 1000:                  time ./aRead 1000:
real	10.956s                     real: 0.020s

The reason why aRead is a lot faster than sRead for both small and large number
of executions is that it uses all CPU resources so that CPU won't be idle while 
waiting for data return from read.
