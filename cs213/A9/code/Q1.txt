If we adjust the assert function to test if buf equal to number other than 
blockno, we get a fail assertion which means buf is stored in the correct
blockno. This can be proved by printing out each buf and blockno. 

time ./sRead 10:
real	0m0.113s

time ./sRead 100:
real	0m1.088s

time ./sRead 1000: 
real	0m10.956s

The time needed to read 10 blocks is approximately 0.1s, then for 100 blocks 
is about 1s and for 1000 blocks it become about 10s. The reason behind this 
,I believe, is that each buff is corresponded to one blockno, the running time
for reading a block is constant. In our case, the time took for reading one
block is about 0.01s. This explains why we get 10 times multiples for each execution,
and the execution becomes slower and slower for increasing size of executions.
